"""
cc-bridge — Claude Code (CLI) ↔ M5StickC buddy daemon.

Long-running process. Listens on a Unix socket for hook events forwarded
by tools/cc-bridge/hook.py, aggregates them into the heartbeat schema
documented in REFERENCE.md, and writes the resulting JSON to the stick's
Nordic UART RX characteristic over BLE.

Stick firmware needs zero changes — it's the same wire protocol Claude
Desktop already speaks. We're just a new producer.

Lifecycle:
  - Stick must be bonded with macOS first (System Settings → Bluetooth,
    enter the 6-digit passkey shown on the stick screen). This is a
    one-time UX dance that bleak's connect path expects.
  - Daemon scans for advertising name "Claude-*", connects to NUS RX
    characteristic, and stays connected. On disconnect (stick power
    off, desktop took over, etc.), it reconnects with backoff.
  - Hook events arrive as one JSON object per line on the Unix socket.
    Each event mutates BuddyState; after every mutation we re-emit a
    fresh heartbeat. A 10s keepalive heartbeat fires regardless.

Run manually:
  python3 tools/cc-bridge/bridge.py
Run as launchd daemon:
  see tools/cc-bridge/install.sh
