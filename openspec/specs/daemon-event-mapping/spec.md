# daemon-event-mapping

## Purpose

The bridge daemons (`tools/cc-bridge/bridge.py`, `tools/cursor-bridge/bridge.py`)
translate IDE hook events into mutations of the shared `BuddyState`
(`tools/buddy_core/core.py`). `apply_event(state, ev) -> bool` is the pure core of
that translation: it mutates `state` in place and returns `True` when the change is
material enough to warrant an immediate heartbeat emit.

This spec captures the *current* behaviour of that mapping. It is the source of truth
for what the firmware HUD's R (running) / W (waiting) / token counters and the status
message mean.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Session counting

`apply_event` MUST track the number of live IDE sessions in `state.total`, keyed by
session id in `state._sessions`.

#### Scenario: Session starts
- GIVEN a fresh `BuddyState`
- WHEN a `SessionStart` event arrives with a new session id
- THEN `state.total` is incremented and the id is recorded in `state._sessions`

#### Scenario: Session ends
- GIVEN a `BuddyState` with one tracked session
- WHEN a `SessionEnd` event arrives for that id
- THEN the id is removed from `state._sessions` and `state.total` is decremented (floored at 0)

#### Scenario: UserPromptSubmit without a prior SessionStart
- GIVEN a `BuddyState` with no tracked sessions
- WHEN a `UserPromptSubmit` event arrives for an unknown id
- THEN the session is created and `state.total` is incremented (treated as an implicit start)

### Requirement: Running counter

`state.running` MUST reflect the number of sessions with an in-flight assistant turn.

#### Scenario: Prompt submitted
- GIVEN a tracked session that is not running
- WHEN a `UserPromptSubmit` event arrives for it
- THEN the session is marked running, `state.running` is incremented, and `state.msg` becomes `"thinking…"`

#### Scenario: Turn ends
- GIVEN a tracked session that is running
- WHEN a `Stop` event arrives for it
- THEN the session is marked not-running, `state.running` is decremented (floored at 0), and `state.msg` becomes `"ready"`

### Requirement: Tool activity message

While a tool runs, `state.msg` MUST reflect the tool name so the firmware can map it
to the BUSY state.

#### Scenario: Tool starts
- GIVEN any `BuddyState`
- WHEN a `PreToolUse` event arrives with `tool_name`
- THEN `state.msg` becomes `"running: <tool>"` and an entry is added

#### Scenario: Tool finishes
- GIVEN any `BuddyState`
- WHEN a `PostToolUse` event arrives with `tool_name`
- THEN `state.msg` becomes `"done: <tool>"`

### Requirement: Permission waiting state

When the IDE blocks on a user decision, `apply_event` MUST surface it via
`state.waiting` and `state.prompt` so the firmware can show the ATTENTION state,
and MUST clear them once the session is no longer blocked.

#### Scenario: Permission requested
- GIVEN a `BuddyState` with `waiting == 0`
- WHEN a `PermissionRequest` event arrives for a non-`SAFE_TOOLS` tool
- THEN `state.waiting` is set to 1, `state.prompt` is populated with `{id, tool, hint}`, and `state.msg` becomes `"approve: <tool>"`

#### Scenario: Safe tools never block
- GIVEN a `PermissionRequest` event
- WHEN the tool is in `SAFE_TOOLS` (AskUserQuestion, *PlanMode, TodoWrite, Task*)
- THEN `state.waiting` and `state.prompt` are left untouched

#### Scenario: Waiting clears when the turn ends
- GIVEN a `BuddyState` with `waiting == 1` from a prior `PermissionRequest`
- WHEN a `Stop` event arrives
- THEN `state.waiting` is reset to 0 and `state.prompt` is set to `None`

#### Scenario: Waiting clears when a tool starts
- GIVEN a `BuddyState` with `waiting == 1` from a prior `PermissionRequest`
- WHEN a `PreToolUse` event arrives (the pending permission was granted)
- THEN `state.waiting` is reset to 0 and `state.prompt` is set to `None`

#### Scenario: Waiting clears when a new turn starts
- GIVEN a `BuddyState` with `waiting == 1` from a prior `PermissionRequest`
- WHEN a `UserPromptSubmit` event arrives
- THEN `state.waiting` is reset to 0 and `state.prompt` is set to `None`

### Requirement: Token accounting

When the IDE reports token usage, the daemon SHALL accumulate it into
`state.tokens` and `state.tokens_today`.

#### Scenario: Cursor reports output tokens
- GIVEN a Cursor `afterAgentResponse` event carrying `output_tokens`
- WHEN `apply_event` (cursor-bridge) processes it
- THEN `state.tokens` and `state.tokens_today` are incremented by that amount

#### Scenario: Claude Code provides no token data
- GIVEN the cc-bridge daemon
- WHEN it processes Claude Code hook events
- THEN `state.tokens` is left at 0 — Claude Code's standard hook events carry no
  token-usage field, so cc-bridge has no source to accumulate from. Surfacing a
  live token count for this path needs a separate data source (e.g. transcript
  tailing) and is tracked as future work, not a defect in this mapping.

### Requirement: HUD metrics event

`apply_event` MUST accept a `hud` event carrying live statusline metrics and copy
them onto `BuddyState` so the firmware HUD can display context window usage, real
token counts, rate-limit pressure, the active model, and session elapsed time.

The `hud` event is pure telemetry — it MUST NOT mutate the session / running /
waiting lifecycle counters.

#### Scenario: HUD event populates metric fields
- GIVEN any `BuddyState`
- WHEN a `hud` event arrives with `context_pct`, `tokens`, `limit_5h`, `limit_7d`, `model`, `session_ms`
- THEN each present field is copied onto `state` and `apply_event` returns `True`

#### Scenario: Partial HUD event leaves missing fields untouched
- GIVEN a `BuddyState` with `model` already set
- WHEN a `hud` event arrives that omits `model`
- THEN `state.model` keeps its previous value

#### Scenario: HUD event does not disturb lifecycle counters
- GIVEN a `BuddyState` with `running == 1` and `waiting == 1`
- WHEN a `hud` event arrives
- THEN `state.running` and `state.waiting` are unchanged

### Requirement: HUD metrics in the heartbeat

`BuddyState.to_payload()` MUST include the HUD metric fields on every heartbeat so
the firmware always has the current values (they are state, not one-shot events).

#### Scenario: Heartbeat carries HUD fields
- GIVEN a `BuddyState` with HUD fields populated by a prior `hud` event
- WHEN `to_payload()` is called
- THEN the payload includes `context_pct`, `tokens`, `limit_5h`, `limit_7d`, `model`, `session_ms`

### Requirement: Camera frame ingest server

`buddy_core/core.py` MUST run an asyncio TCP server, started from `run()`, that
accepts a single StackChan camera frame stream. Frames arrive as a 4-byte
little-endian length header followed by a JPEG payload. The server MUST tolerate
the StackChan connecting and disconnecting as permission-prompt windows open and
close.

#### Scenario: StackChan connects and streams
- GIVEN the daemon `run()` loop is active
- WHEN the StackChan opens the frame socket and sends a length-prefixed JPEG
- THEN the server decodes one complete frame and hands it to the gesture
  classifier

#### Scenario: StackChan disconnects
- GIVEN an open frame stream
- WHEN the StackChan closes the socket (its prompt cleared)
- THEN the server releases the connection and waits for the next one without
  error

### Requirement: Gesture classification with a hold window

The daemon MUST classify decoded frames into `thumbs-up` / `thumbs-down` / `none`
via MediaPipe Hands, and MUST require the same non-`none` gesture across a
debounce/hold window before it counts as confirmed. MediaPipe MUST be an optional
import — if unavailable, frames are dropped and gesture-approve degrades to
manual approval without crashing.

#### Scenario: Sustained gesture confirmed
- GIVEN a pending permission prompt and a frame stream
- WHEN the same `thumbs-up` is detected across the full hold window
- THEN the gesture is confirmed as `approve`

#### Scenario: Flickering gesture not confirmed
- GIVEN a frame stream
- WHEN a `thumbs-up` appears for fewer frames than the hold window
- THEN no decision is confirmed

#### Scenario: MediaPipe unavailable
- GIVEN a daemon where the MediaPipe import failed
- WHEN frames arrive
- THEN they are logged and dropped; no crash; the permission prompt remains
  resolvable manually

### Requirement: Confirmed gesture resolves the pending permission

When a gesture is confirmed while `state.prompt` is set, the daemon MUST send
`{"cmd":"gesture","result":"approve"|"deny"}` back to the firmware for UI
feedback, and MUST route the decision into the same Claude Code permission
resolution path that a manual approval uses. A confirmed gesture for a tool in
`SAFE_TOOLS` is a no-op (those never block).

#### Scenario: Confirmed approve resolves the prompt
- GIVEN a `BuddyState` with `state.prompt` set for a non-`SAFE_TOOLS` tool
- WHEN a gesture is confirmed as `approve`
- THEN the daemon sends `{"cmd":"gesture","result":"approve"}` to the firmware
  and the pending Claude Code permission is approved

#### Scenario: Confirmed deny resolves the prompt
- GIVEN a `BuddyState` with `state.prompt` set
- WHEN a gesture is confirmed as `deny`
- THEN the daemon sends `{"cmd":"gesture","result":"deny"}` to the firmware and
  the pending Claude Code permission is denied

#### Scenario: Gesture confirmed with no pending prompt
- GIVEN a `BuddyState` with `state.prompt` unset
- WHEN a gesture is confirmed
- THEN no permission decision is made and no gesture command is sent

### Requirement: Session staleness tracking

cc-bridge's `apply_event` MUST stamp `state._sessions[sid]["last_seen"]` with
`time.monotonic()` on every branch that creates or accesses a session's
record. This is the single source of truth the reaper uses to decide
whether a session is alive.

#### Scenario: SessionStart stamps last_seen
- GIVEN a fresh `BuddyState`
- WHEN a `SessionStart` event arrives for a new sid
- THEN `state._sessions[sid]["last_seen"]` is set to roughly the current monotonic time

#### Scenario: Every per-session event stamps last_seen
- GIVEN a `BuddyState` with one tracked session
- WHEN any of `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`,
  `PermissionRequest`, `Notification` arrives for that sid
- THEN `state._sessions[sid]["last_seen"]` is refreshed to roughly the
  current monotonic time

### Requirement: Stale-session reaper

cc-bridge MUST run a background reaper that drops sessions idle for longer
than `STALE_SESSION_SEC` (default 600 s) and recomputes `state.total` and
`state.running` from the surviving session map. The reaper protects against
unbounded counter drift when `Stop` events are dropped upstream.

#### Scenario: Stale session is removed
- GIVEN `state._sessions = {"s1": {"running": True, "last_seen": t-999}}`
  and `state.running == 1`
- WHEN the reaper runs with `STALE_SESSION_SEC = 600`
- THEN `"s1"` is removed from `state._sessions` and `state.running` is recomputed to 0

#### Scenario: Counter drift corrected by recompute
- GIVEN `state.running == 5` but `state._sessions` actually contains only
  two records both with `running: True`
- WHEN the reaper runs and none of them are stale
- THEN `state.running` is recomputed to 2 (the truthful count)

#### Scenario: Non-stale sessions are left alone
- GIVEN `state._sessions` contains a session with `last_seen = monotonic() - 10`
- WHEN the reaper runs with `STALE_SESSION_SEC = 600`
- THEN that session is unchanged

### Requirement: Compaction visibility

`apply_event` MUST surface context compaction so the displays explain the
pause instead of showing stale state.

#### Scenario: Compaction starts
- GIVEN any `BuddyState`
- WHEN a `PreCompact` event arrives
- THEN `state.msg` becomes `"compacting…"` and a transcript entry is added

#### Scenario: Compaction ends
- GIVEN any `BuddyState`
- WHEN a `PostCompact` event arrives
- THEN `state.msg` becomes `"compacted"` and a `"compacted"` transcript entry is added

### Requirement: Subagent visibility

`apply_event` MUST add transcript entries for subagent lifecycle events.

#### Scenario: Subagent starts with a type
- GIVEN a `SubagentStart` event carrying `agent_type`
- WHEN it is applied
- THEN a transcript entry naming that agent type is added

#### Scenario: Subagent stops
- GIVEN a `SubagentStop` event
- WHEN it is applied
- THEN a `"subagent done"` transcript entry is added

### Requirement: Tool failure visibility

`apply_event` MUST distinguish failed tool calls from successful ones.

#### Scenario: Tool fails
- GIVEN a `PostToolUseFailure` event with `tool_name == "Bash"`
- WHEN it is applied
- THEN `state.msg` becomes `"failed: Bash"` and a transcript entry starting with `"✗ Bash"` is added

### Requirement: Lifecycle event registration

`install.sh` SHALL register `PreCompact`, `PostCompact`, `SubagentStart`,
`SubagentStop`, `PostToolUseFailure` as async hooks alongside the existing set,
so the daemon actually receives them.

#### Scenario: Fresh install registers the lifecycle events
- GIVEN a fresh run of `tools/cc-bridge/install.sh`
- WHEN the hook entries are written to `~/.claude/settings.json`
- THEN `PreCompact`, `PostCompact`, `SubagentStart`, `SubagentStop` and
  `PostToolUseFailure` each carry an async hook invoking `hook.py`
